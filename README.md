#Rails with PostgreSQL on Docker using Fig


Docker is a platform for building, shipping and running all sorts of applications (source). 
It’s a very powerful and extensible alternative to other forms of virtualization and 
platforms like Heroku. This post described the steps I’ve taken to get an existing Rails 
app onto Docker using Fig.

## How to 

1. Install docker on your system
2. Clone this repo
3. Run ```docker build .```
4. Install Fig
5. Make your app container friendly
6. Boot the application on Docker
7. Runn tests from Docker via Fig
